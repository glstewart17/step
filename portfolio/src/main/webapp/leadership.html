              <h4><b>Convert to Code Co-Founder</b></h4> 
              <p>Convert to Code was the student-run organization that I co-founded. It sought to facilitate 
                computer science education in Lancaster County through free monthly workshops and a hackathon. 
                Over its three year lifespan, we reached over 200 students. I ran the organization for the first 
                year of existence, this entailed scheduling a location, advertising the event, and finding a
                local professional willing to teach. As I gained more CS experience, I helped the teachers with
                their workshops and eventually taught what later turned out to be the final Convert to Code
                workshop.

              <h4><b>DevPSU Administrator</b></h4> 
              <p>I found DevPSU during my first semester at Penn State when looking for ways to enrich my 
                computer science education. DevPSU is a branch of the Penn State Association that focuses 
                on teaching students the development skills not taught in the classroom. I learned a great 
                deal in their workshops and through their startup program. Upon conclusion of the program, 
                I discovered that I wanted to help run the organizaiton. Now I am overseeing the DevPSU and 
                actively working to bring in more students and bridge gaps in knowledge. I have always felt 
                that technical education is incredibly important and I want to play whatever role I can in 
                facilitating CS education at Penn State.
