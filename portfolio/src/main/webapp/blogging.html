      <p>"Some archeologists believe that Stonehenge - the mysterious arrangement of enormous elongated stones 
          in England - is actually a crude effort by the Druids to build a computing device." - Dave Barry

      <p>My blogs are no great feat. But like Stonehenge, maybe they will make you wonder.

              <h4><b>The Potential of AI</b></h4> 
              <p>Over the course of my Spring 2019 semester I wrote a blog about artificial intelligence. 
                I selected this topic, because I feel as though it will become increasingly more relevant 
                in the near future. Additionally, I am quite passionate and interested in the topic. While 
                there are many new developments, there is significant room for social and technical improvement, 
                and I want to be a part of it.

              <h4><b>Amish Tech</b></h4> 
              <p>During my first semester at Penn State, I took some time to explore the technological happenings 
                of Lancaster County. Each post highlights an entirely different topic. There were a few 
                posts centered around events and groups that offered tech-related gatherings for the 
                public. Additionally, there were several promising tech companies in Lancaster that were 
                highlighted.
