      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I grew up in a small town in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. During my time there, I engaged in many extracurricular activities and volunteer 
        organizations: National Honor Society, Science Olympiad, Varsity Volleyball, Varsity Golf, Interact Club, Student Council, and Student Government. 
        I graduated second in my class of 237 in June 2018. While I took a great deal away from high school education, it lacked computer science classes, 
        like many schools in the area.
        
      <p>Coding was something I always wanted to learn about, but never knew where to start. So, when two former classmates came to me about starting a community organization 
        that empowers students to learn about computer science, I agreed. The organiztion we co-founded was called Convert to Code. As the other co-founders left for college, 
        I was left to run Convert to Code for approximately the first year. I was a high school senior with no programming experience running an organization that teaches 
        students about computer science. By talking with the professionals who agreed to teach the worskshops we organize and helping students during our events, I was able 
        to learn a great deal about computer science and grow more passionate about programming. While Convert to Code only lasted 3 years, in that time we reached over 200 
        students through our monthly workshops and a hackathon.

      <p>I originally applied to college as a Mechanical Engineering major, but after finding my passion for computer science, it was an easy decision to make the switch
        when I began my first semester at Penn State. In addittion to my classwork, I have taken a leadership role in Penn State's ACM club. One major component of the club
        is DevPSU, which holds a series of lectures to teach students the software development skills that their classes do not, and hosts a startup program which assigns
        students into teams and provides them with a real world project to work on, sometimes even for compensation. As the DevPSU Admisistrator, I oversee theses two 
        offerings and look to provide better continuity between them. In my freetime, I enjoy participating in competitive coding trainings, hackathons, and pickup basketball
        and volleyball.

      <p>Thanks to Convert to Code, I was able to start my professional career the summer after my senior year of high school. A former instructor and mentor got me a job as 
        a site reliability engineer intern at the WebstaurantStore, an online restaurant equitment retailer that generates over a billion dollars in annual revenue. The
        following summer I worked as a software developer intern at DNV GL, an international company based out of Norway. DNV GL has business in many different sectors,
        including maritime, oil, renewables, and healthcare. I worked on a team developing a new cloud based gas and fluid pipeline integrity systems.

      <p>Now, I am a STEP intern at Google, who is excited to see what the future holds.
