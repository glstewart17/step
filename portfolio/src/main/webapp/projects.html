      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>In addition to my professional and school work, I have a couple projects that I would like to share. 
        Having only recently started coding, there are just a few works that I feel are worth displaying. Moving 
        forward, I will be adding to this list as I see fit. While my classes are educational, I feel as though 
        I learn the most when working on these side-projects. Nothing brings me greater joy than being able to 
        work on something I am passionate about.

              <h4><b>Shopify Analytics Application</b></h4> 
              <p>I developed a Shopify store analytics application for Wavebreak’s clients through the DevPSU 
                Startup Program. I designed the entire front-end using React and Polaris libraries to allow 
                seamless transitions between the store and application. Also, I worked on the backend set up, 
                handled the order data request, and completed data analytics to provide the stores with 
                meaningful information.

              <h4><b>SMS SummarAIze</b></h4> 
              <p>Built for a Hackathon with a group of friends, this project was a simple NLG that used a 
                Wikipedia library to train a model to the extent that it can output nonsensical sentences 
                about any desired topic through our web application. I focused on the web application at 
                the time. Recently, I updated the summary scripts, deployed it to the cloud, and provided 
                an SMS endpoint to make it more accessible.
