        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>In addition to my professional and school work, I have a couple projects that I would like to share. 
          Due to my other involvements, there are just a few works that I feel are worth displaying. Moving 
          forward, I will be adding to this list as I see fit. While my classes are educational, I feel as though 
          I learn the most when working professionally or on side-projects. Nothing brings me greater joy than 
          being able to work on something I am passionate about.

                <h4><b>Shopify Analytics Application</b></h4> 
                <p>I developed a Shopify store analytics application for Wavebreakâ€™s clients through the DevPSU 
                  Startup Program. I designed the entire front-end using React and Polaris libraries to allow 
                  seamless transitions between the store and application. I also assisted with the backend, 
                  handled the order data, and completed data analytics to provide the stores with meaningful 
                  information.

                <h4><b>SMS SummarAIze</b></h4> 
                <p>Built for a Hackathon with a group of friends, this project was a simple NLG that used a 
                  Wikipedia library to train a model to the extent that it could output nonsensical sentences 
                  about any desired topic through our web application. I focused on the web application at 
                  the time. Recently, I updated the summary scripts, deployed it to the AWS, and provided 
                  an SMS endpoint to make it more accessible.
