# Google Student Training in Engineering Program

This repo contains Gabe's portfolio and the work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.

## Portfolio 

The primary focus of this program was to develop a portfolio site.

### Design

* I created and styled a header and footer
  * Stuck footer to the bottom, no matter length of page
  * Used images for special links
* Made an image slider
  * Setup slider to switch images every 5 seconds
  * Images can also be selected within the slider
* Create links and brief summaries of other pages
* Includes a comment sections for users
* Required users to sign in to comment
* Allow users to edit username, image, and delete old comments

### Notes

* I've never written raw HTML and CSS to this degree, always used frameworks and exsisting styles in the past
* HTML and CSS of slider based on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp)
